This is minimal valid devfile. `apiVersion` must be specified. It is used for devfile validation. Currently we have only `1.0.0`.
For metadata, we can use either `name` or `generateName`. The workspace name will be derived from it. It further depend on a way we choose to create a workspace. We will use `generateName` and we will create a workspace with factory so new workspace should be named with `generateName` and 5 random characters.
