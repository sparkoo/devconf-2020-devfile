Now let's define our own components. We have 2 options here. First for java backend. We'll define it as a `dockerimage` component. Here, we need to define docker image we want to use. Again define `memoryLimit` and we want to mount the sources into the container. We'll also define endpoint for backend REST API. It will be public so it can be reached by the frontend.
